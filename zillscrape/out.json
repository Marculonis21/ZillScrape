It is perched on the edge of the Hollywood Hills, where the air carries the scent of trees and distant rain. This is no ordinary house; it is a place that belongs to the land, carved into the hillside as if it has always been there. You can feel the pull of it: the stillness, the quiet resolve of a home that knows itself, with a view that will captivate you every day and never lose its wonder. The light comes through the windows in golden streaks, clean and unrelenting. It fills the rooms and leaves no corner untouched. The kitchen is new, but it is not boastful. It is sharp and strong, with new appliances and countertops. A pantry that is deep and practical, designed to store supplies for long, satisfying meals or the simple comforts of daily living.A window, round and unblinking, is cut into the wall. It frames the view like a painting you don't need to buy. Trees stretch out to meet the hills, and the hills climb to meet the mountains. The city lies below, its hum distant and unimportant. From here, it doesn't matter. What matters is the quiet, the space, and the feeling that this home is built to last. The bedrooms are below, tucked into the hillside like a secret. The primary bedroom has its own ensuite bathroom and a terrace, a private space for mornings with coffee and the sound of birds. The second bedroom opens onto another balcony, where you can sit and watch the day begin or end.The garage is not just a garage. It could be an office, a studio, or a place to sit and think. There is room for parking, living, and the kind of life that doesn't demand explanation. The house is close to Mulholland Drive, close to Laurel Canyon. It is near the bustle of Ventura Boulevard and the charm of Studio City. But it is not part of any of those places. It is its own place, set apart, waiting for someone who understands what it is.   This is a house for living, not in the way most people talk about it, but in the actual kind of living. The kind where you wake up, feel the sun on your face, breathe in the smell of trees, and know you've found something rare. Something that matters. This is the kind of setting that could have inspired Ernest Hemingway to craft one of his timeless masterpieces. Welcome home."},

It is a mid-century modern structure, remodeled with precision and care, tucked into the iconic walk streets, just steps from the rhythm of the ocean and the pulse of the city.  Inside, there is light. The kind of light that comes through floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass doors spreads across the polished terrazzo floors in a quiet, almost unsettling way. You don't notice it at first, but it's always there, shaping the space. The wood beam vaulted ceilings stretch above, lending a kind of calm that seems both familiar and foreign in its beauty. The kitchen, a masterwork of function and design, offers a cool, clean contrast to the warm finishes of the original wood, the built-ins, and the bespoke touches that tell you someone cared. Sub-Zero refrigerators, freezers, and wine storage stand like silent sentinels, their quiet luxury punctuated by Miele and Bosch appliances. It is the kind of kitchen you would imagine a person who knows how to live would want to spend time in, not just to cook but to exist. The bedrooms are not so much spaces as they are moments soft, deliberate, and quiet. The primary suite opens onto a private patio where the air, heavy with the scent of sea salt and jasmine, moves through the room like an old friend. There is a walk-in closet that promises both privacy and possibility and the bathroom, with its spa-like serenity, will feel familiar the first time you step into it, as though it has always been yours.  Outside, the gardens have been designed with care, lush yet low-maintenance, a reflection of the delicate balance between the land and the people who live on it. Walkways curve with purpose, leading you through this little oasis, a place where thoughts can rest. Then there is the auxiliary building detached, finished, and ready for whatever you decide to make of it. It could be a studio, an office, or a place to lose yourself for hours in whatever it is you are searching for. It's a space that allows for possibility.  You are steps away from the ocean, from the grit and glamour of Venice Beach, from dining, shopping, culture, and everything Los Angeles has to offer. This is a place where design meets history, where function meets beauty, where the past and present come together in the quiet, insistent way that only Venice can offer. This home rare, extraordinary, and simple in its perfection is a place where you can finally stop searching. It is waiting for you."},

Alternatively, descending a few steps, one enters a private suite of three bedrooms, along with an additional den or office space, complete with built-in desk and access to the outdoors. Two newly designed bathrooms in pink and in blue harmonize with the color-scheme of the house and sage green window frames.  The heart of the home is its main living space, where a soaring, beamed ceiling emphasizes the spatial drama, and large windows along the southern facade flood the area with natural light, framing picturesque views of the surrounding hillside. Trapezoidal clerestory windows at either end follow the atypical post-and-beam structure of the roofline, offering carefully composed vistas. Original built-in plywood elements functionally and visually separate the entrance and dining area, preserving an open yet delineated spatial flow for both public and private use. A decorative fireplace anchors the opposite side of the living space, extending to the flat yard and creating a cohesive indoor-outdoor connection. A balcony adjoins the dining area, while the kitchen features a built-in nook, perfectly situated to take in the surrounding views through a large glass window. The kitchen with marble countertops in light green and pink tones that complement cabinetry in a similar light pink hue is outfitted with modern, high-end appliances and flows effortlessly into a service balcony that provides further access to the garden. The residence is built into the hillside, the back of the house anchoring into the terrain, creating a natural privacy that allows all rooms to open to the expansive garden and an oval-shaped pool at the lower level, surrounded by lush trees. According to family tales it was designed by Richard Neutra.  The home has been comprehensively renovated to preserve Schindler's original design while incorporating modern amenities. Updated spaces include newly designed bathrooms, kitchen, refinished hardwood floors, and a new walk-in closet in the primary bedroom. Privacy and security have been enhanced with a newly installed gate and alarm system, while the landscaping has been rejuvenated with drought-tolerant California native plants.
